## Doing

Make it harder to get the kanji the more times you see it:
- Remove the kanji drawing at a certain level of familiarity with the kanji.
- fade out the drawing slowly over time and over stroke order ( )

Improve the kanji stroke detection ( increase number of ref points slightly + increase tolerance?)



## Todo
remove bug where a missile randomly flickers in and out of existence

Have some representation of order and direction on the kanji. ( color and arrows?)

Increase the number of kanji, based on the kanji power book

Adapt the kanji input sampling to make it less dense

simple gui to see the score

Orbit controls for the level

Think of a way to implement simply drawing a kanji to lock to a certain kanji ( highlight the kanji that is locked? ) Can still keep the tap to override the lock.
